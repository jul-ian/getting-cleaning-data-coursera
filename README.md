# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Overview

This is the repository containing files for the peer graded assignment for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera. The repository contains the following important files:

- tidy_data.txt: 	A tidy dataset created using human activity data provided by Smartlab (Non-Linear Complex Systems Laboratory)
- codebook.md:		The codebook describing the included tidy_data.txt dataset, as well as the dataset used to create it

## Analysis Script

The run_analysis.R script provided was used to clean the raw data provided by the laboratory. The data was provided as a set of train and test cases, so both were concatenated to create the final data. Labels were provided for the activity being performed by the subject, and these were merged into the full data.

## Codebook 

The provided codebook gives an overview of how the data was collected, as well as giving a comprehensive list of the provided variables in the tidy dataset.
